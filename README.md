# PIston Exercise for CoDeSys

This repository contains a free exercise designed to help you take your first steps in developing state machines using CoDeSys.

**What you will learn:**

* Basic concepts of state machines.
* Implementing state transitions in CoDeSys.
* Simulating a real-world system (a piston moving a generic product).

**Prerequisites:**

* **CoDeSys V3.5 SP19 Patch 5 (3.5.19.50) or later installed.** This exercise has been tested with this specific version.
* **Basic familiarity with the CoDeSys IDE.**

**How to Run:**

1.  Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2.  Open the project file (likely a `.project`) in CoDeSys.
3.  **Enable Simulation Mode:** In CoDeSys, go to the "Online" menu and select "Simulation". Ensure the simulation mode is active.
4.  Run the simulation. You should now be able to interact with the simulated train level crossing based on the logic implemented in the project.

**Getting Started:**

The project includes comments and a basic structure to guide you through the implementation of the piston logic using a state machine.
